# BetGameKotlinApi

A Spring Boot + Kotlin API that provides endpoints to register, bet, and retrieve bets.

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running:

# 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

# 2. Install Docker Desktop
Ensure that Docker Desktop is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" target="_blank">Docker website</a>.

# 3. Initialize the Application Services
Open the project in your IDE, then open a terminal and run the following command to start the application services, including a PostgreSQL database:

`docker-compose up`

This command creates a new container in the Docker environment and starts a PostgreSQL image.
